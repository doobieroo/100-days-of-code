# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Friday, December 29, 2017

**Today's Progress** Reworking my much neglected personal portfolio page (doobieroo.com). Spent time monkeying with Boostrap and Font Awesome.

**Thoughts** Been feeling like a lot of my skills are sketchy, but had a great day because I spent a whole hour without distractions. Proud of my focus!
